# Graphs
Graph representations, algorithms and visualizations in python

# Directory
`graphs.py` is the dense file filled with all the graph things, will be made into a package later ideally

`circuits.py` is a weird subset of graphs for calculating and displaying electronic circuits with resistors

`konisberg.py` is a crude way of solving one of the problems we came across (possible number of walks)
